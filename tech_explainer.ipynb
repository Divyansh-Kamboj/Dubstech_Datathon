    "* **Goal**: Visualize the *consequence* of waiting.\n",

    "* **Target**: Time to Adverse Event (based on Length of Stay and Disposition).\n",
    "* **Insight**: This generates the \"Survival Curves\" in the dashboard, showing that Oncology patients deteriorate faster than Mental Health patients if funding is delayed."
